  description: "One possible effect of Marfan syndrome is lung collapse (pneumothorax). While this condition is usually not life-threatening, it is an emergency.
  Lung collapse happens when air escapes the lung into the space between the lung and the inner lining of the chest. When there is too much air inside the chest cavity, pressure builds up on the lungs, which can cause the lung to collapse. Typically, spontaneous pneumothorax is caused by the bursting of over-expanded lung air sacs call apical blebs or bulia. These blebs are weakened areas of the lungs. If the bleb breaks open (ruptures), it can send air into the space around the lung, causing the lung to collapse. In the Marfan lung, sudden lung collapse can be recurrent, present in both lungs, and/or associated with emphysema.
  The symptoms of lung collapse are shortness of breath, a dry cough, and often sudden onset of pleuritic chest pain (pain that gets worse when you take a deep breath). The pain may be confused with an aortic dissection or heart attack, and requires evaluation in an emergency room. In a large pneumothorax, a person may have a bluish skin color due to the lack of oxygen, chest tightness, easy fatigue, and rapid heart rate.",

  description: "In Marfan syndrome and some related disorders, the aorta may become enlarged (aortic dilation) and the walls of the aorta may bulge (aortic aneurysm). Medical issues related to the heart and blood vessels affect about 9 out of every 10 people diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. These are very serious problems because a significantly enlarged aorta is at risk for tearing or rupturing (aortic dissection). For most people with Marfan syndrome, the problem starts in the segment of the aorta closest to the heart (the aortic root). Doctors use a person’s age, height, and weight to determine whether or not the aorta is enlarged.
  Doctors use the term “Z-score” to describe the size of an aorta. The Z-score is a number that determines how far the aorta’s size is from normal. Z-scores are used because the size of the aorta changes dramatically from childhood to adulthood, so the size measurement alone is not informative unless placed in relation to your age, as well as height, weight, and gender. Both aortic size measurement and Z-score are important; however, the Z-score is used more often for children because the aorta is still growing and it provides an indication of how large the aneurysm is compared to the body size and this is more valuable information than the actual aortic size, especially when deciding about the timing of preventative aortic aneurysm surgery. Talk with your doctors about what size aorta is within normal limits for you." ,

They may describe the pain as “sharp,” “tearing” or “ripping.”  The location of the pain may change. Sometimes, the pain is less severe, but people still have the feeling that “something is very wrong.” If a dissection is suspected, a person needs immediate medical attention and should go to a hospital emergency department right away.
  There are two types of aortic dissection:
  • Dissection of the ascending aorta. The ascending aorta is the part of the blood vessel that begins closest to the heart; it is usually about the first two inches of the vessel. A dissection of the ascending aorta is the most common in Marfan syndrome and it is life-threatening. When this happens, a person needs immediate surgery. Most ascending dissections in Marfan syndrome continue into the descending and abdominal aorta.
  • Dissection of the descending aorta. The descending aorta comes down after the aortic arch and goes downward into the chest cavity and below the waist. A dissection in this part of the blood vessel can often be managed with medication and monitoring. Surgery is needed only if there are serious complications, such as loss of blood flow to vital organs, aortic rupture, or an extremely enlarged aorta.",

  description: "Scoliosis is a curving of the spine to one side in which the vertebrae (bones in the spine) twist, usually into an S-shape or spiral shape. Scoliosis can be in any part of the spine, but is most common in the upper spine. About 6 in 10 people with Marfan syndrome have scoliosis, but only 1 in 3 need medical treatments for it.
  Scoliosis is caused when ligaments in the spine are so loose they cannot firmly hold the vertebrae in place. Rapid growth in a child with Marfan syndrome can also make scoliosis increase. This often happens with the growth spurt during adolescence (teen-age years).
  Scoliosis can be mild to severe, based on the size of the curve. Curves are measured by the angle between the vertebrae (as seen on the x-ray on the following page), given as a number or degrees. A small curve (less than 20 degrees) in an adolescent has a low chance of worsening. A moderate curve (20–40 degrees) has a greater chance of worsening in a child or adolescent. A large curve (more than 40 degrees) almost certainly will worsen, in either a child or an adult. This is because there is already so much imbalance in the spine that gravity will continue to worsen it.
  All children are usually checked for scoliosis in school in the fifth grade. However, children with Marfan syndrome should be checked for scoliosis by their pediatrician even before fifth grade, then at each annual physical exam. This is done by having the child bend forward while a doctor or nurse examines the back. If a child does not show signs of scoliosis by the start of middle school, he or she probably will not develop it to a significant degree later in life. Scoliosis rarely begins in adulthood. Adults with scoliosis should be checked every 1 to 3 years.",

Pain and numbness in the perineum (the area between the legs in front of the anus) can also occur. Sitting for long periods of time may cause pain in people with dural ectasia. Making the diagnosis of dural ectasia may be important to meeting diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome
  Dural ectasia also thins the spinal vertebrae, which can have implications for someone having surgery on the spine for any reason.
  The need for an evaluation depends on the degree of symptoms and disability. If you can tolerate the symptoms, there is no urgency for an evaluation. Dural ectasia is best identified through MRI imaging, particularly of the lower spine with a person standing upright.

  Among people who are the same age, weight, and height, sleep apnea is more prevalent in people who have Marfan syndrome than in those who don’t. Unfortunately, sleep apnea is often underdiagnosed in the Marfan community. In the general population, the majority of people who are diagnosed with sleep apnea are overweight. People with Marfan syndrome usually aren’t overweight, so sleep apnea is frequently overlooked or not suspected as a diagnosis.
  Sleep apnea is thought to be more common in the Marfan community because of head and facial abnormalities, such as floppy airway tissue, high arched palate, and retrognathia (a deformity of the jaw where the jaw is small, or recessed, which can cause the airway to be obstructed).
  Studies have shown that untreated sleep apnea can cause aortic wall stress, a particular concern in Marfan syndrome. This makes it extremely important to diagnose and treat sleep apnea if it is suspected. If you suspect you have sleep apnea it is important to see a pulmonologist (lung doctor) to receive the correct diagnosis.
  The symptoms of sleep apnea are chronic (ongoing) and loud snoring, pauses in snoring that are followed by choking or gasping, and snoring that worsens when sleeping on your back and lessens when sleeping on your side. Often, family members or a bed partner will notice these symptoms before you do. Other symptoms of sleep apnea are sleepiness during the day, at work, or when driving, morning headaches, and dry mouth or sore throat when you wake up.
