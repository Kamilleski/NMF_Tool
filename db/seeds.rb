  description: "Pneumothorax, which is also known as collapsed lung, involves lung collapse or lung detachment from the chest wall. It can happen spontaneously, meaning there is a lung collapse without any cause. When a lung collapse occurs, air escapes from the lungs and fills up the space outside of the lung, inside the chest. In the Marfan lung, pneumothorax can be recurrent, present in both lungs, and associated with emphysema. A person with pneumothorax may experience shortness of breath, dry cough, an acute onset of pleuritic chest pain (chest pain that gets worse when you take a deep breath), or chest pain that gets worse when coughing.",

  common_name: "enlarged aorta" ,
  systemic_category: "Cardiovascular",
  description: "In Marfan syndrome and some related disorders, the aorta may become enlarged (aortic dilation) and the walls of the aorta may bulge (aortic aneurysm). Medical issues related to the heart and blood vessels affect about 9 out of every 10 people diagnosed with Marfan syndrome. These are very serious problems because a significantly enlarged aorta is at risk for tearing or rupturing (aortic dissection). For most people with Marfan syndrome, the problem starts in the segment of the aorta closest to the heart (the aortic root). Doctors use a person’s age, height, and weight to determine whether or not the aorta is enlarged.
  Doctors use the term “Z-score” to describe the size of an aorta. The Z-score is a number that determines how far the aorta’s size is from normal. Z-scores are used because the size of the aorta changes dramatically from childhood to adulthood, so the size measurement alone is not informative unless placed in relation to your age, as well as height, weight, and gender. Both aortic size measurement and Z-score are important; however, the Z-score is used more often for children because the aorta is still growing and it provides an indication of how large the aneurysm is compared to the body size and this is more valuable information than the actual aortic size, especially when deciding about the timing of preventative aortic aneurysm surgery. Talk with your doctors about what size aorta is within normal limits for you." ,

  name: "aortic tear or rupture",
  common_name: "aortic dissection",
  systemic_category: "Cardiovascular",
  description: "A tear or rupture between layers of the aortic wall is called an aortic dissection. When this happens, people experience severe pain in the center of their chest, stomach, or back. They may describe the pain as “sharp,” “tearing” or “ripping.”  The location of the pain may change. Sometimes, the pain is less severe, but people still have the feeling that “something is very wrong.” If a dissection is suspected, a person needs immediate medical attention and should go to a hospital emergency department right away.
  There are two types of aortic dissection:
  • Dissection of the ascending aorta. The ascending aorta is the part of the blood vessel that begins closest to the heart; it is usually about the first two inches of the vessel. A dissection of the ascending aorta is the most common in Marfan syndrome and it is life-threatening. When this happens, a person needs immediate surgery. Most ascending dissections in Marfan syndrome continue into the descending and abdominal aorta.
  • Dissection of the descending aorta. The descending aorta comes down after the aortic arch and goes downward into the chest cavity and below the waist. A dissection in this part of the blood vessel can often be managed with medication and monitoring. Surgery is needed only if there are serious complications, such as loss of blood flow to vital organs, aortic rupture, or an extremely enlarged aorta.",

Symptoms can include irregular or rapid heartbeats and shortness of breath. Some people also have leaking of the mitral valve. A small amount of leaking is usually not a problem, but surgery may be needed if the mitral valve leaks severely. Sometimes, mitral valve prolapse can cause a heart murmur, an abnormal sound that a doctor can hear through a stethoscope. Mitral valve prolapse is present in 5 percent of the general population and about 60% of people with Marfan syndrome.",

  common_name: "scoliosis",
  systemic_category: "Musculoskeletal",
  description: "Scoliosis is a curving of the spine to one side in which the vertebrae (bones in the spine) twist, usually into an S-shape or spiral shape. Scoliosis can be in any part of the spine, but is most common in the upper spine. About 6 in 10 people with Marfan syndrome have scoliosis, but only 1 in 3 need medical treatments for it.
  Scoliosis is caused when ligaments in the spine are so loose they cannot firmly hold the vertebrae in place. Rapid growth in a child with Marfan syndrome can also make scoliosis increase. This often happens with the growth spurt during adolescence (teen-age years).
  Scoliosis can be mild to severe, based on the size of the curve. Curves are measured by the angle between the vertebrae (as seen on the x-ray on the following page), given as a number or degrees. A small curve (less than 20 degrees) in an adolescent has a low chance of worsening. A moderate curve (20–40 degrees) has a greater chance of worsening in a child or adolescent. A large curve (more than 40 degrees) almost certainly will worsen, in either a child or an adult. This is because there is already so much imbalance in the spine that gravity will continue to worsen it.
  All children are usually checked for scoliosis in school in the fifth grade. However, children with Marfan syndrome should be checked for scoliosis by their pediatrician even before fifth grade, then at each annual physical exam. This is done by having the child bend forward while a doctor or nurse examines the back. If a child does not show signs of scoliosis by the start of middle school, he or she probably will not develop it to a significant degree later in life. Scoliosis rarely begins in adulthood. Adults with scoliosis should be checked every 1 to 3 years.",

If swelling occurs, it is frequently in the lower part of the lumbar or sacral spine. Sometimes, the enlarged sac will actually press into adjacent spaces, such as the pelvis.
  The presence of dural ectasia does not always cause problems, although in some people it causes aching in the very low back, almost in the tailbone, as well as abdominal pain, headaches, and leg pain. Pain and numbness in the perineum (the area between the legs in front of the anus) can also occur. Sitting for long periods of time may cause pain in people with dural ectasia. Making the diagnosis of dural ectasia may be important to meeting diagnostic criteria for Marfan syndrome
  Dural ectasia also thins the spinal vertebrae, which can have implications for someone having surgery on the spine for any reason.
  The need for an evaluation depends on the degree of symptoms and disability. If you can tolerate the symptoms, there is no urgency for an evaluation. Dural ectasia is best identified through MRI imaging, particularly of the lower spine with a person standing upright. A mylogram, CT scan, or plain spinal films might also reveal the presence of dural ectasia.",
